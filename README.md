# Getting Started with KIB Task

This project was bootstrapped with [Vercel](https://ms14-kib.vercel.app/).

## How to run

if you clone the project, you can run:

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## How it work

first you need to upload a CSV file (which I upload in the repo depending on the Sample Explanation in the code challenge PDF file order_log00)

after uploading a CSV file (order_log00) I will create a table of CSV file data with export option and has three buttons below it

first button will show the 0_order_log00 table, with export option ,which show the most popular brand

second button will show the 1_order_log00 table, with export option ,which show the avg of product per order

third button will show both tables together
